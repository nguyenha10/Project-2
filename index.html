				<h3>Kodak Gold 200</h3>
				<p>Kodak is an iconic brand that always springs to mind when you think of film photography, and the Kodak Gold 200 has long been a popular choice for film negative. It reproduces natural colours with just a subtle grain and a gorgeously vintage look. You’ll get the best photos with great colour saturation and sharpness using the Kodak Gold 200 when you shoot in daylight or with a flash – Kodak don’t recommend you use this film at dusk or in low lights.</p>

				<h3>Fujicolor Pro 400H</h3>
				<p>Fujicolor Pro 400H 120 hasn’t always reached the pinnacles of popularity, but it’s a decent film that produces photos with real character. Sometimes compared to the Kodak Portra, portraits especially shine when shot with the Fujicolor Pro 400H. It’s definitely one of the top negative films around.

			<h1>Guide</h1>
			<p>Photographic film is made from strips or plastic film coated with a gelatin emulsion containing light-sensitive silver halide crystals. When exposed to light through the camera's lens, the emulsion undergoes a slight chemical change, capturing latent images on the film's surface that can be chemically developed into printed images. The required exposure time and image quality can vary, depending on the type of equipment and film you're using, as well as lighting conditions and whether you're using automatic or manual camera settings.</p>

				<h3>A Brief History of Kodak: The Rise and Fall of a Camera Giant</h3>
				<p>Kodak was once the 800-pound gorilla in the world of photography. But after a century of dominance, Kodak’s business crumbled and it was forced to declare bankruptcy in 2012. If you’d like to better understand what happened to the iconic brand, watch this great 12-minute video by the popular YouTube channel Company Man.</p>

				<h3>How to Develop Rolls of Film</h3>
				<p>Although it's harder to find places that process roll film these days, you may find drug stores, local camera shops, and mail-order outfits that offer film developing services, especially for the more common types, such as 35mm film. The turnaround time can vary from same-day service to a week or longer if the film is being shipped out for processing. If you're feeling adventurous, consider purchasing a film developing kit that comes with all the tools and chemicals you'll need to develop pictures right at home. Not only will you have more control over the final product, but you'll also learn the darkroom tricks that make photography magic happen.</p>

				<h3>Digital vs. Traditional Photography</h3>
				<p>You might wonder how digital photography and traditional film compare in terms of quality. Everyday users may find that the on-demand convenience of digital photography suits their needs just fine; no film to process, instant results, and numerous computer programs and phone apps you can use to make quick edits. Since no film is used, you can take pictures when the moment strikes, without a bunch of accessories, filters, and expensive lenses, plus no concerns about the film's shelf life.</p>

				<h3>Street life photography</h3>
				<p>Street photography, also sometimes called candid photography, is photography conducted for art or enquiry that features unmediated chance encounters and random incidents[1] within public places. Although there is a difference between street and candid photography, it is usually subtle with most street photography being candid in nature and some candid photography being classifiable as street photography. </p>
